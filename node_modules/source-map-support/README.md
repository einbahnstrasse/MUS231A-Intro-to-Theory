# Source Map Support
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/evanw/node-source-map-support.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/evanw/node-source-map-support)

This module provides source map support for stack traces in node via the [V8 stack trace API](https://github.com/v8/v8/wiki/Stack-Trace-API). It uses the [source-map](https://github.com/mozilla/source-map) module to replace the paths and line numbers of source-mapped files with their original paths and line numbers. The output mimics node's stack trace format with the goal of making every compile-to-JS language more of a first-class citizen. Source maps are completely general (not specific to any one language) so you can use source maps with multiple compile-to-JS languages
